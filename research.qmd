### Ongoing and past projects

#### **1. Phonological representations**

![](figures/bebi.jpeg){.main-figure title="Penelope being cute"}Most of my research focuses on how speakers build phonological representations, based on evidence from natural language grammars, experiments, phonetic data and corpus data. For example, in both collaborative and sole-authored work, I have investigated the effect of prosodic factors on the manifestation of rhotics in Brazilian Veneto, the patters of metaphony in Brazilian Veneto, the relationship between vowel reduction and phonological structure in Brazilian Portuguese, and the structural conditioning of high vowel deletion in Québec French.
<!-- I have investigated whether prosodic constituents can be identified based on indirect phonological evidence or subtle phonological phenomena, and whether prosodic constituency constrains (subtle) phonological variation. Recently, I have examined the realization of rhotic sounds in Brazilian Veneto (Talian), a language that has a single rhotic phoneme that seems to be manifested differently depending on position and stress. With <a href="https://guilhermegarcia.github.io" target="_blank">Guilherme Garcia</a>, I have examined vowel reduction in neoclassical elements in Brazilian Portuguese as a way to determine their prosodic representation. With <a href="http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~heather.goad/" target="_blank">Heather Goad</a> and Guilherme Garcia, I have probed whether foot structure in Québec French can be identified on the basis of weakening segmental processes such as variable high vowel deletion.  -->

#### **2. The acquisition of phonological representations**

I have examined the development of phonological representations in monolingual and bilingual acquisition. I have investigated the acquisition of affricates relative to the acquisition of branching onsets in Québec French (where affricates are in complementary distribution with coronal stops). In collaborative work, I have examined whether children acquiring two languages with distinct representations for word-level stress (such as French and English) are able to differentiate between the two systems.
<!-- under the hypothesis that the constraints regulating the distribution of affricates are onerous for children, resulting in affricates being acquired after branching onsets.   -->

#### **3. Phonological representations in a situation of language contact**

I have also investigated how language contact affects speakers' phonological representations. My focus is on Portuguese-Veneto contact in a region of southern Brazil known as the Italian Immigration Area (IIA). I have also worked on a description of the Brazilian Veneto (Talian) phonological/phonetic system.  **See more about this project [here](talian.html).**

#### **4. Effects of prosody on sentence interpretation**

![](figures/dengo.jpeg){.main-figure title="Peggy being cute"}In both joint and single-authored research, I have investigated how prosodic cues (such as pauses, changes in pitch, stress, and constituent size) impact native speakers' and second language learners' interpretations of ambiguous sentences. I have so far worked on ambiguous sentences involving depictive predicates in Brazilian Portuguese, relative clauses in English, and anaphoric pronouns in Italian.

#### **5. Prosodic organization**

In research stemming from my dissertation, I have examined how clitics and compounds in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) are mapped into prosodic domains. The phonological behaviour of certain clitics and compounds in BP supports two assumptions about prosodic structure which had previously been considered as mutually exclusive: (a) the idea that there is a specific prosodic domain for the representation of composite structures (the composite group; Vogel, 2009), and (b) the idea that prosodic domains can be recursive (e.g., Inkelas, 1990; Selkirk, 1996).
