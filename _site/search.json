    "text": "Project by: Natália B. Guzzo and Guilherme D. Garcia\nWe are working on documenting Talian, an understudied variety of Veneto spoken in several areas of Brazil. Our work involves the development of a corpus of written materials in Talian as well as data collection through fieldwork. \nIn the 19th century, many Italians immigrated to North and South America. In Brazil, they first settled in the southeastern region, where many were employed in coffee farms. Later, other immigrants settled in the southern region (especially in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul), where they were offered land (through government loans) but faced harsh conditions to farm it. As time went by, a variety of Veneto, Brazilian Veneto, developed in the area(s) where the immigrants settled. Speakers refer to this variety as Talian.\nAlthough Talian is spoken in several areas of Brazil, our main focus is on a region called Italian Immigration Area (IIA), the area of Rio Grande do Sul where Italian immigrants arrived first. The photo shown here was taken in the town of Antônio Prado.\n\n\nThe Italian Immigration Area in Brazil\nIn the map below, the towns and cities in red have Talian as their co-official language, alongside (Brazilian) Portuguese. They gray circle is an approximation representing the IIA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nOur project would not be possible without the help of the following people:\n\nOur language consultants, Maria Inês Chilanti and Lenise Baldin Cavazzola.\nOur experiment participants.\n\nOur research assistants: Émilie Dubé, Alexandra Lancaster, Ray Marks, Fabian McCarthy, Lamia Oudni, Carolyn Rathgeber, and Jovia Wong (McGill); Jenna Gramlich (Ball State); Hannah Markert (Saint Mary’s); Gabriel Frazer-Mckee (Université Laval).\n\nWe also thank Dr. Valdemir Guzzo (Natália’s dad) for helping us find additional corpus materials as well as more information on the history of the IIA.\n\n\n\nFunding\nThis project was awarded a Jovem Talento grant (2021–2022) by Brazil’s federal funding agency CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education); declined due to conflicting schedule issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2024 Natália Brambatti Guzzo",

    "text": "Ongoing and past projects\n\n1. Phonological representations\nMost of my research focuses on how speakers build phonological representations, based on evidence from natural language grammars, experiments, phonetic data and corpus data. For example, in both collaborative and sole-authored work, I have investigated the effect of prosodic factors on the manifestation of rhotics in Brazilian Veneto, the patters of metaphony in Brazilian Veneto, the relationship between vowel reduction and phonological structure in Brazilian Portuguese, and the structural conditioning of high vowel deletion in Québec French. \nOutput:\n\nGuzzo, Natália Brambatti. submitted.

The acquisition of phonological representations\nI have examined the development of phonological representations in monolingual and bilingual acquisition. I have investigated the acquisition of affricates relative to the acquisition of branching onsets in Québec French (where affricates are in complementary distribution with coronal stops). In collaborative work, I have examined whether children acquiring two languages with distinct representations for word-level stress (such as French and English) are able to differentiate between the two systems. \nOutput:\n\nGuzzo, Natália Brambatti. 2022.

Phonological representations in a situation of language contact\nI have also investigated how language contact affects speakers’ phonological representations. My focus is on Portuguese-Veneto contact in a region of southern Brazil known as the Italian Immigration Area (IIA). I have also worked on a description of the Brazilian Veneto (Talian) phonological/phonetic system. See more about this project here.\nOutput:\n\nGuzzo, Natália Brambatti. 2022.

Effects of prosody on sentence interpretation\nIn both joint and single-authored research, I have investigated how prosodic cues (such as pauses, changes in pitch, stress, and constituent size) impact native speakers’ and second language learners’ interpretations of ambiguous sentences. I have so far worked on ambiguous sentences involving depictive predicates in Brazilian Portuguese, relative clauses in English, and anaphoric pronouns in Italian.\nOutput:\n\nGuzzo, Natália and Chau Tran. in prep.

Prosodic organization\nIn research stemming from my dissertation, I have examined how clitics and compounds in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) are mapped into prosodic domains. The phonological behaviour of certain clitics and compounds in BP supports two assumptions about prosodic structure which had previously been considered as mutually exclusive: (a) the idea that there is a specific prosodic domain for the representation of composite structures (the composite group; Vogel, 2009), and (b) the idea that prosodic domains can be recursive (e.g., Inkelas, 1990; Selkirk, 1996).\nOutput:\n\nGuzzo, Natália Brambatti. 2018.

The photo shows Talian speakers in São Domingos (a district of Sananduva, Rio Grande do Sul), circa 1940.\nTalian is a Veneto-based Romance language, and it has some aspects in common with other languages from the same family, such as:\n\nseven vowels in stressed position, exactly like Italian and Portuguese;\na (relatively) rich agreement system;\n(preverbal) object clitics, like Italian, Spanish and French;\nthe past tense is formed by auxiliary verb + past participle, like Italian and French.\n\nTalian’s lexicon has incorporated several words from Brazilian Portuguese: zacaré (from jacaré ‘alligator’), sorasco (from churrasco ‘barbecue’), sinela (from chinelo ‘sandal’).\nBecause Italian immigrants came from different regions in Italy, very few communities in the IIA spoke a single language or dialect—see table below (Frosi and Mioranza 2009, 47). The contact between the various languages spoken by immigrants, the predominance of Veneto dialects among such languages, and the scarce contact with Portuguese favored the development of a Veneto-based dialect in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion of origin\n%\n\n\n\n\nVeneto\n54.0\n\n\nLombardia\n33.0\n\n\nTrentino-Alto Adige\n7.0\n\n\nFriuli Venezia-Giulia\n4.5\n\n\nOthers\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Vento del Norte e el Sol\nEl Vento del Norte e el Sol i zera drio discùter qual zera el pi forte,\nquando un viaiante el ze rivà vestio con na capa grossa.\nI ga dessidio che’l primo que podesse far el viaiante tirar zo la capa\ndovea esser considerà el pi forte de luri due.\nLora el Vento del Norte el ga sufià el màssimo che’l podea,\nma de pi che’l sufiea de pi el viaiante se enrolea ntela so capa;\ne par fin el Vento del Norte el ga desistio.\nLora el Sol el ga slusà ben caldo,\ne el viaiante suito el ga tirà zo la so capa.\nE così el Vento del Norte el ga tocà acetar\nche’l Sol el zera el pi forte de luri due.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2024 Natália Brambatti Guzzo\nReferences\n\nFrosi, Vitalina Maria, and Ciro Mioranza. 2009.
